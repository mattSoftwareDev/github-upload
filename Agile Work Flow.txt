...Story Format
As a <role>
I want to <specific task>
So that <reason/supported workflow area>

...INVEST criteria for user stories:
Independent
Negotiable
Valuable
Estimate-able
Small
Testable

...Epics are 'story arcs' that captures a complete workflow, not deliverable until all related stories are complete, & can cater to multiple users.

...Themes: Stories are related (or all serve a similar goal), do not need to encapsulate a workflow, & can be delivered independently of one another.

...Acceptance Criteria
Given...
When...
Then...

...
Writing criteria is the first step to working on the story
Agree on criteria before coding begins
Use criteria as the basis for test cases
